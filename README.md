Boston Housing Model: A Beginner-Friendly Linear Regression
Overview: The Boston Housing dataset is a classic dataset used for regression analysis. It contains information about housing prices in the suburbs of Boston, with 506 instances and 13 features.

Objective: The goal is to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes (in $1000s) using a linear regression model.

Steps:

Data Preparation:
Load the dataset: Use libraries like pandas and scikit-learn to load and explore the dataset.
Feature Selection: Identify the features (e.g., number of rooms, crime rate) that will be used to predict the target variable (housing prices).
Splitting the Data:
Training and Testing: Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance.
Building the Model:
Linear Regression: Use the LinearRegression class from scikit-learn to create and train the model on the training data.
Model Evaluation:
Predictions: Use the trained model to predict housing prices on the test data.
Performance Metrics: Evaluate the model using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
